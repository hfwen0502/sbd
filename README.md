# Library for selected basis diagonalization

This is a header-only library for diagonalizing quantum systems in a selected basis, with a focus on handling wavefunction vectors that are too large to fit in the memory of a single node.
The library leverages MPI-based parallelization to distribute the wavefunction across multiple nodes.
Sample usage examples are provided in the `/apps` directory.

- Tomonori Shirakawa, RIKEN Center for Computational Science

## Versions

- **v1.0.0**: Initial public release corresponding to the arXiv submission.
- **v1.1.0**: Feature additions, refactoring, and bug fixes
- **v1.2.0**: Feature additions (sbd for general determinant), and bug fixes

## Requirement

- Message Passing Interface (MPI)
- OpenMP
- BLAS and LAPACK

## Install

- This code is provided as a header-only llibrary, so no installation is required.

## How to Compile the Sample Codes

- The sample code for parallelized selected basis diagonalization for tensor-product basis is located in `apps/chemistry_tpb_selected_basis_diagonalization`.
- Edit the configuration file to suit your environment and build it with the make command.
- For more information and options for the executable, see README.md in the same directory.
- From v1.1.0, the sample code for parallelized selected basis diagonalization for general Hamiltonian written by creation/annihilation operator is added in `apps/caop_selected_basis_diagonalization`.
- From v1.2.0, the sample code for parallelized selected basis diagonalization for quantum chemistry Hamiltonian in the general determinant basis is added in `apps/chemistry_gdb_selected_basis_diagonalization`.
